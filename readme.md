Game has 5 stages, with each stage being harder.
A computer picks a random number, and you (a human) have to guess it.
Computer gives you a hint if your number is bigger or smaller then his.
You have a limited number of tries, but you can gain them more when you progress through stages.
At first stage, a computer picks a number between 1 and 10.
In the second stage, a computer picks a number between 1 and 100.
All other stages increase a range of numbers a computer can choose from.

Bonus feature: you can bid points that you will guess a number in x number of tries.



Game doesn't support negative numbers.
Game plays through terminal.
Comments in the code are in slovene.
This project was done through my course in University.
